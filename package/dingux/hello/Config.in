config BR2_PACKAGE_HELLO
	bool "hello"
	help
	  The GNU hello program produces a familiar, friendly greeting.           It allows non-programmers to use a classic computer science
          tool which would otherwise be unavailable to them.
          Seriously, though: this is an example of how to do a dingux
          package. It is the dingux version of the GNU Project's
          `hello world' program
